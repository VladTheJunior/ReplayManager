## About The Project

Replay Manager is an update to Records Parser tool from ESO Tracker developed in 2019 for Legacy version of Age of Empires 3. It shows most of the useful information needed to analyze recorded game. 
If you have information or desire to help in testing or development, then leave a message in the topic on the official forum or DM me in Discord.

* Shows ALL (even not used) players decks with ability to make a screenshot.
* Shows list of all important game actions(chat, train units, build, shipment, spawn unit, research tech, selected deck, resigned, cheat tech) with timestamp.
